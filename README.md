For the assignment we are asked to conceptualise and code a system to apply the object-oriented
programming concepts learned in class. For this purpose we choose to implement a document man-
agement system in a library. Our library will include several types of documents linked by notions
of inheritance. Our library will also have a list of members. With the help of this model, we will be
able to implement the 20 requested notions.


============================================================================================


In the main function to test all implemented notions you just have to undo the comments.
